## Overview

[Oonagability Triffeliz](/) also has a [dog clothing brand](https://www.oonagability.com/) where we create stylish, comfortable, and functional clothing specifically tailored for greyhounds and sighthound breeds.

Born out of a passion for animal care and high-quality craftsmanship, our brand was established in 2020 when our founder adopted her first greyhound, Harper.

We observed that while there were products in the market, most did not accommodate the unique body shape of Harper. This motivated us to create clothing lines that would provide perfect fit and comfort to greyhounds, without any hassle of dressing them.

Today, our products are adored not only by greyhounds but also by their loving pet parents who trust our brand for our quality and design aesthetics. Our clothing is 100% handmade by our dedicated team based in Melbourne, promising the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship.

## Our Vision

At Oonagability Triffeliz, our vision is to create a world where every greyhound feels comfortable and loved, irrespective of the weather. We understand that greyhounds feel the cold more than other breeds due to their thin fur and low body fat. Hence, we have made it our mission to cater to these unique needs by creating garments specifically designed for them.

## Education

We maintain an active blog where we share useful articles on greyhound care, their behaviour, and even fun recipes for treats, to help pet parents understand and take care of their pets in the best way possible.

## The Journey So Far

After successfully selling greyhound pyjamas on Facebook Marketplace, Etsy, and eBay, we launched www.oonagability.com in 2023. Since then, we have grown into a trusted brand loved by greyhound owners and enthusiasts.
