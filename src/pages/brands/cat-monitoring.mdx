## Safety and Durability

Our device is water-resistant and designed to withstand your cat's daily adventures. However, it's not waterproof. If it does get wet, we recommend removing it from your cat's collar and letting it dry completely before using it again.

Oonagability Triffeliz is more than just a cat tracking device brand. It's a connection to your furry friend that ensures their safety and health, giving you peace of mind. Trust Oonagability Triffeliz to keep you and your pet connected, wherever they roam.
